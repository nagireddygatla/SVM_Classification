Design and Implement your Machine Learning Algorithm on the following Dataset.
1. Classification
Classification is to identify which of a set of categories a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data. In the task 2, we have three different datasets. For each dataset, we provide training dataset, training label, and test dataset. Please use the training dataset and training label to build your classifier and predict the test label.  The class label is represent by integer number.  For example, in the first dataset, there are two classes where 1 represents the first class and 2 represents the second class.
TrainData 1 contains 4434 features with 35 samples. Testdata1 contains 4434 features with 15 samples.  There are 4 classes in this dataset.
TrainData 2 contains 3312 features with 150 samples. Testdata1 contains 3312 features with 53 samples. There are 5 classes in this dataset.
TrainData 3 contains 5966 features with 73 samples. Testdata1 contains 5966 features with 29 samples. There are 2 classes in this dataset.
TrainData 4 contains 9182 features with 100 samples. Testdata1 contains 9182 features with 74 samples. There are 11 classes in this dataset.
 Sample Data:
Training data:
1.1	2.1	2.1	5.2
2.1	2.4	2.4	2.1
3.1	1.5	2.6	1.5
Training label

2
Test data
3.1	2.2	1.5	2.5
2.1	2.1	2.1	2.6
Please use the training data and training label to predict the test label. For example, if your prediction for the test sample is 1, 2. That is, the first sample in the test dataset (first row) is predicted as 1 and second as 2. Then please return me the test result of each dataset as an individual files.

2. Missing Value Estimation
Gene expression data often contain missing expression values and it is very important to estimate those missing value as accurate as possible. The first task of the course project is to estimate missing value in the Microarray Data.
Dataset 1 contains 242 genes with 14 samples.
Dataset 2 contains 758 genes with 50 samples.
Dataset 3 contains 273 viruses with 79 samples. There are only 3815 observed values.
1	1.00000000000000e+99	1.00000000000000e+99
1	1	1
2	2	2
                                                  Table 1
Note that the missing entry is filled by 1.00000000000000e+99.  For example, in the Table 1, the second and third entries in the first row are missing values. There are 4% missing values in the Dataset 1 and 10% missing values in the Dataset 2.  Please fill those missing entries with estimated values and return the complete dataset to me.
